## Problems

web mobile, android ios, react native routes- need some help on web page- extra in app.json script

##App.js

react-router-native instead of -dom- install that

npm i react-route-native
import:
SaveAreaView- insea of View

Wrap application with <NativeRouter>
trhan <SafeAreaView> for natch

underlayColor for link as atribute not style
after safeAreaview

## touchable

do <touchable>
for drag and drop

## routes

quick start reactrouter

MATCH - object from JS, will tell if it is a URL or entire, grab more infos in your URL

routes:
<Route> Home
<Route> About
<Route> More
Routes- will be used to switch components- called screens or normal components. No more web adresses.

screens things ypu may use anywhere
component in that specific one

## Grids

npm i react-native-grid

## sizes

!!! react native heigth and width docs

scrollView
touchable

## backend

fetch from API you created- last session with Hadi

## add tft file

## Context api - try that out, the easiest, backend people should decide

## text on top

zIndex

## on loading

hej underneath loading, than will dissapear

positopn absolute - for hey

to make it sticky on that specific part

menu will always stay there (in Hadis case)

landing page disappears when you click on something, appears on reload of the page

## vibration

android vibrator motor cant distungisg as much as iphone so you need to work with them seperataly
always check which platform you are working with

test any feature from docs- on your phone- with qr code

standard use of const name:
PATTERN - const for vibration, try starter kit from HAdi

## in the last app with pumpkin

press - Alert.alert() - window appearing

## keyboard - to appear

grab it from react native tools
show it
and than hide it
Keyboard.dismiss -
<TextInput>

it appeaed on phone but not on simulator

## switch

agree rules
male femaleas
color it with thumbcolor -slider
trackColor - background of slider
ios_backgroundColor -instead of trackColor for another platforms
