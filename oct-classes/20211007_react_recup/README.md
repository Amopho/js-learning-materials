jsx element needed from react-router-dom

Router- app that has a switch element in it, when you wrapp ypur App

Any component you want to switch- show/hide ... anything in the switch:

Any ither component which has to apear on the website we give outside the switch.

What should be kept- appearing always on the website- like Menu goes outside the switch.

Props sending - component and render want do it.

Fake callback function

Or you can take the route and close it seperetaly <Route><Route/>

You acce the store but you wrap your whole app with your store.

Match set match params and send it and then filter or whatever. You want to click on something and get more data on it.

Regex expression- including/excluding words you want to have.

<Route path={()=> "/main" || "/admin" || "/any-other-word" <regex expression>}>

Addin it at the end is not obligatory but professional, you may build it on the special website.

Sending api keys- all have to been hidden.
Don't share api key they can charge you.
I grab my config.json as object.
React will care for converting your data json.
import config from "./config.json"

style object- build

```javascript
const hederStyle = {
  backgroundColor: "gray",
  color: "white",
};
```

index. js
wrapping while app with the store

in react native no sass, css- you build object with camel case but rules are otherwise the same.
sass and scss exactly the same syntax like scss but has - {}. You need to create scss for the specific syntax.

psedo classes in sass - use them!
