Challenges and Lessons for the future
Short time span for our final project - top down decisions style - every team member was responsible for well defined tasks, prioritize tasks

Available plant APIs served with unstysfying data and most of them was available in english/ we decided to create our own german database of more than 20 plants
React native framework - was differnet than we used to during our course but after some adjustment phase it appeared as a powerfull tool, very satisfactory and fun to work with
Remote working - team work - morning meetings after achieving tasks and flexible hangouts helped knowing better the nedds of the peojects and each other as well
