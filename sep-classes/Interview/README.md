# Interview questions discussed with our teacher Hadi

## 1. Library vs framework

Libraries is a set of predefinrd functions that are doing things for us.

## 2. Compiler - will talk immediattely with a processor

would take what yoy wrote in words it would turn it into machine language (binary 01). Scripting language would take ypu r scriptong language write it into another one and that one would compile it into machine language.

Programming language uses whole the processor and doesn't have to use single thread to work. JAVA, C, C sharp, C++, Python

## 3. Processor

pins - every pin is connected to every device - mic, audio, browser, port- this is the single thread. This single thread is making the whole job. Asonchronously making something- is not to keeping it all the time busy, but it is doing it in the background.

## 4. JS runtime engine vs JS templating engine

## Questions:

1. Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is commonly used for creating web pages. It allows us to add dynamic behavior to the webpage. On websites, it is mainly used for validation purposes. JavaScript helps us to execute complex actions and also enables the interaction of websites with visitors.

Along with HTML and CSS, it's a core component of web technology. While HTML is responsible for structure and CSS is responsible for style, JavaScript provides interactivity to web pages in the browser.

Netscape needed a lightweight scripting language for easier programming. This ultimately made web development more accessible, unlike other languages that required deeper training. Netscape employee Eich built Mocha, which was later renamed JavaScript.

JavaScript is now an essential web technology that’s supported by the most popular web browsers. Familiarity with the language is crucial for anyone who wants to become a web developer

JavaScript became a hit because it turned web browsers into application platforms. Here’s how:

JavaScript can be used in both the front-end and back-end of web development.
JavaScript is standardized, so it’s frequently updated with new versions.
JavaScript works with the document object model, or the DOM, to respond to user interactions. The DOM is the structure in the browser that displays a web pages.

JavaScript allows websites to have interactivity like scroll transitions and object movement. Modern browsers still compete to process JavaScript the fastest for the best user experiences- Chrome.

JavaScript offers a wide range of frameworks and libraries that help developers create complex applications with low overhead.

In the server, JavaScript can be integrated with other languages to communicate with databases. Browsers have engines that can process JavaScript quickly, and this has encouraged more server-side usage. Node.JS, or Node, is one of the most popular versions of server-side JavaScript.

## Event what is it

It is a huge object, holding plenty of informations. This is for example whatever the user made changes on the website.

You want to request each req from client get req from client and compare it with a secret code.
If token is brokewn /old/ wrong- than it

Secret code the most secure. Specicfivc token,has a secretcode inside of it. In this case you have a unique token, that nobody may repeat on the world.

## Authentication vs Authorization

checking if it's the rigth user aka (correct u)
allowing the correct user to acces
