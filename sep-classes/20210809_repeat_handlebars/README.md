## Handlebars

content type : application/-xxx-...
received from form, you dont make json (false(object, key)) anymore, you are doing express.urlencoded- , but if you will have an object of a object - extended: true.

Middlewares dont have a return to not to break an app, it it is true it will move foreard to the next one.

Passing req to the validationResults and fill this object, i f I will have errors- good show them.
errors array is not empty, than else happens

### If i created a new user and have username and password, how can I check if are they alligning with my database. If I have that username two times? Register- check by name- If i have alreday that name, if i do i will reasign the name.to not to make app going crazy.
